This repository contains a Haskell code example demonstrating a common error in list comprehensions. The `bug.hs` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the corrected version. The error arises from an improper conditional expression within the list comprehension, leading to an inaccurate sum of squares of even numbers. The solution clarifies the correct use of the conditional statement to filter even numbers accurately before squaring and summing them.
